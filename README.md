---
## In a Jupyter Notebook:
* Import the Data (provided in the starter code)
* Prepare the Data (provided in the starter code)
* Find the Best Value for `k` Using the Original Data
* Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the Original Data
* Optimize Clusters with Principal Component Analysis
* Find the Best Value for `k` Using the PCA Data
* Cluster the Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the PCA Data
* Visualize and Compare the Results
